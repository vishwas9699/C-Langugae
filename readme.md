# C_Programming_Language


### C Programming Language



The C Language is developed for creating system applications that directly interact with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.

C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language.

It can be defined by the following ways:
* Mother language
* System programming language
* Procedure-oriented programming language
* Structured programming language
* Mid-level programming language

------

##### 1) C as a mother language

* C language is considered as the mother language of all the modern programming languages because most of the compilers, JVMs, Kernels, etc. are written in C language, and most of the programming languages follow C syntax, for example, C++, Java, C#, etc.

* It provides the core concepts like the array, strings, functions, file handling, etc. that are being used in many languages like C++, Java, C#, etc.

-------

##### 2) C as a system programming language

* A system programming language is used to create system software. C language is a system programming language because it can be used to do low-level programming (for example driver and kernel). It is generally used to create hardware devices, OS, drivers, kernels, etc. For example, Linux kernel is written in C.

* It can't be used for internet programming like Java, .Net, PHP, etc.

----------

##### 3) C as a procedural language

* A procedure is known as a function, method, routine, subroutine, etc. A procedural language specifies a series of steps for the program to solve the problem.

* A procedural language breaks the program into functions, data structures, etc.

* C is a procedural language. In C, variables and function prototypes must be declared before being used.

--------------

##### 4) C as a structured programming language

* A structured programming language is a subset of the procedural language. Structure means to break a program into parts or blocks so that it may be easy to understand.

* In the C language, we break the program into parts using functions. It makes the program easier to understand and modify.

-------------

##### 5) C as a mid-level programming language

* C is considered as a middle-level language because it supports the feature of both low-level and high-level languages. C language program is converted into assembly code, it supports pointer arithmetic (low-level), but it is machine independent (a feature of high-level).

* A Low-level language is specific to one machine, i.e., machine dependent. It is machine dependent, fast to run. But it is not easy to understand.

* A High-Level language is not specific to one machine, i.e., machine independent. It is easy to understand.
